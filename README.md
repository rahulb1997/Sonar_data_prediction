# Rock vs Mine Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code and data related to predicting whether a given object is a rock or a mine using machine learning. The model is built using logistic regression, and the dataset includes 61 different features obtained from sonar readings.

## Files

1. **sonar_data.csv:** This file contains the dataset with 61 features extracted from sonar readings, along with the corresponding labels indicating whether the object is a rock or a mine.

## Data Structure

### sonar_data.csv

- **Feature_1 to Feature_61:** Numeric features extracted from sonar readings.
- **Label:** Target variable indicating whether the object is a rock ("R") or a mine ("M").

## Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Objective:** Predicting whether a given object is a rock or a mine based on the sonar features.

## Google Colab Notebook
